    /**Explanation:
     FixedThreadPool:

     Creates a pool with a fixed number of threads. In this case, we have set it to 2 threads.

     Tasks are submitted and executed by reusing these 2 threads.

     CachedThreadPool:

     Creates a thread pool that can dynamically add threads as needed but will reuse previously constructed threads.

     Good for short-lived tasks where the number of threads can vary.

     SingleThreadExecutor:

     Ensures that all submitted tasks are executed sequentially by a single worker thread.

     Itâ€™s useful when the tasks need to be executed in order and there should be no concurrency.

     ScheduledThreadPool:

     Executes tasks periodically.

     schedule() runs a task once after a fixed delay,

     scheduleAtFixedRate() runs tasks periodically with a fixed time interval,

     scheduleWithFixedDelay() runs tasks with a fixed delay between the end of one execution and the start of the next.*/
